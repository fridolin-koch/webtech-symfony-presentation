$ app/console generate:doctrine:crud

  Welcome to the Doctrine2 CRUD generator



This command helps you generate CRUD controllers and templates.

First, you need to give the entity for which you want to generate a CRUD.
You can give an entity that does not exist yet and the wizard will help
you defining it.

You must use the shortcut notation like AcmeBlogBundle:Post.

The Entity shortcut name: AppBundle:Project

By default, the generator creates two actions: list and show.
You can also ask it to generate "write" actions: new, update, and delete.

Do you want to generate the "write" actions [no]? yes

Determine the format to use for the generated CRUD.

Configuration format (yml, xml, php, or annotation) [annotation]:

Determine the routes prefix (all the routes will be "mounted" under this
prefix: /prefix/, /prefix/new, ...).

Routes prefix [/project]:
